When estimate MLE, I hope to directly estimate it by

```R
  # x are the observations
  gamma_den <- function(para){
    alp <- para[1]
    bet <- para[2]
    n <- length(x)
    return(-(n*alp*log(bet)-n*log(gamma(alp))+(alp-1)*sum(log(x))-bet*sum(x)))
  }

  stats::optim(par = c(1,1), fn = gamma_den, method = "L-BFGS-B", lower = 0)
```R

or

```R
  gamma_den <- function(para){
    -sum(stats::dgamma(x, para[1], para[2], log = TRUE))
  }

  stats::optim(par = c(1,1), fn = gamma_den, method = "L-BFGS-B", lower = 0)
```

Obviously, there is no difference between those two method except I don't need to 
type the gamma density fundtion.
Here, the problem is that when liklihood function is monotone in the domain, 
the optim can't return the MLE. For example, 

```R
  x <- 1:10
  stats::optim(par = c(1,1), fn = gamma_den, method = "L-BFGS-B", lower = 0)
```

returns errors.

Some people mentioned that 'stats4::mle' is more robusted for mle.
However, from the source code

```R
  oout <- if (length(start)) 
    optim(start, f, method = method, hessian = TRUE, ...)
  else list(par = numeric(), value = f(start))
```
the mle is also from 'optim' and the problem is not fixed.

What I can do now is

```R
tryCatch(stats::optim(par = c(1,1), fn = gamma_den,
                                        method = "L-BFGS-B",lower = 0)$par,
                           error = function(e) NA)
'''                           

It works for no doubt but I sure if there might exist better solutions.
